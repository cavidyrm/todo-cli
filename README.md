# todo-cli
This is a simple and small CLI to practice with command-line tools concepts written in GO.

I'm working on this tool using flag package in Go, it has one flag, and it receives your commands include: register a new user, login, create task, show tasks list etc, it has a file storage to save user’s account and save progress. It’s using Json marshalling to serialization and Json Unmarshalling to load users from a txt file.

It’s just a simple tool to practice with CLI concepts and I’m working on it and trying to learn more about command-line tools.
